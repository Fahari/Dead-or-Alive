## Description

Simulation game made of grids and cells. Built with LUA and Javascript.

## How it works

```
There is a grid of cells, which are either alive or dead.

After a step of time:

Alive cells with exactly two or three alive neighbors live on.
Dead cells with exactly three alive neighbors become alive.
All other cells die or remain dead.

Alive cells are pink in color
Dead cells are grey in color

Hold any key to step forward in time, and observe.
